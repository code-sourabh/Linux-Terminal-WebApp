ðŸ“Œ In this project I have created a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) by showing some creativity and UI/UX designing skills to make the webportal user friendly. 

ðŸ“Œ This app will help the user to run all the docker commands like: 
 
  ðŸ‘‰docker images 
  ðŸ‘‰docker ps 
  ðŸ‘‰docker run 
  ðŸ‘‰docker rm -f 
  ðŸ‘‰docker exec 
  ðŸ‘‰ add more...........
